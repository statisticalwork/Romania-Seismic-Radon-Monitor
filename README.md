üîß What This Python Script Does:

1. Fetches real data from a remote API (geobs.infp.ro) for:

Radon levels from known stations (e.g., DLMdd, LOPRdd, etc.).

CO‚ÇÇ levels, applying offset for certain stations.


2. Fetch data for:
Atmospheric chemical potential ACP

3. Adds alert levels depending on thresholds (like red, green, orange).
- standalone on selected stations
- all station
- combined, eg  Radon + Co2

4. Outputs JSON (sensors.json) to be read by the interactive HTML map.

üìÅ Download the generated JSON for preview/use: Click to download sensors.json


ü§ñ What the AI Script Do (Model Integration):

The AI component is intended to:

Train a simple prediction model using past sensor data (you‚Äôll feed it with historical radon, CO‚ÇÇ, or ACP/PRC	Pattern Recurrence Cycle, SPM	Synodic Pattern Match, RPG	Resonant Planetary Geometry values).

Predict the next mean values or anomalies based on current readings and patterns.

Automatically flag counties with expected high risk (color-coded).

Eventually support seismic signal classification or anomaly prediction if trained EHZ data.
